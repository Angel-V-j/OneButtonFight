# OneButtonFight
A short copy of the game "One Btn Bosses" by me.
I have used MonoGames' framework to make this game.
In this game the only control you have is over your ship's rotation. By pressing the key "Space" you are change your rotation's direction. You should only change your direction to dodge an enemy attack. Because by changing it you slow down your ship's speed.
